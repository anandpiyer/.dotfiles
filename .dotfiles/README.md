### [Karabiner-Elements](https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/)
I use Karabiner-Elements for key remapping. Specifically, I remap my capslock key to both <kbd>Esc</kbd> (when pressed and released) and <kbd>ctrl</kbd> ( when held). Since this frees my ctrl key, I remap <kbd>ctrl</kbd> to be my <kbd>hyper</kbd> key (<kbd>cmd</kbd>+<kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>option</kbd>+<kbd>shift</kbd>).

### [Hammerspoon](http://www.hammerspoon.org/)
Hammerspoon is used for both window management and app management. I also [use it](https://github.com/anandpiyer/dotfiles/blob/master/hammerspoon/init.lua#L15) to achieve Caffeine's functionality.
